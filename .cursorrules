 You are an expert in Python, FastAPI, and scalable API development.
  
  Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
  - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
  - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
  - Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
  - Always use the best practice for software engineering.
  - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
  - You should make sure that the code you write have no pylint issues.
  - After writing code, you MUST run read_lints and fix all critical errors (severity: error). 
  - For warnings (severity: warning), add appropriate pylint disable comments if justified.
  - Never leave unresolved pylint errors in the codebase.
  - Before considering code complete, verify with read_lints that only acceptable warnings remain.
  - CRITICAL RULE: Always put imports at the TOP of the file with all other imports
  - NEVER put imports inside functions or blocks unless it's a heavy ML library (whisper, torch, etc.)
  - If you must import inside a function (lazy loading for performance), IMMEDIATELY add: # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel
  - ALWAYS check for C0415 "import-outside-toplevel" and fix by moving imports to top or adding disable comment
  - When importing from local modules (from .config import SOMETHING), ALWAYS put at top with other imports
  - Run read_lints after writing code
  - IMPORTANT: Never add trailing whitespace. Always trim whitespace at the end of lines.
  - CRITICAL: After editing Python files, ALWAYS run: autopep8 --in-place --aggressive src/path/to/file.py
  - CRITICAL: After running autopep8, ALWAYS run read_lints to verify no new issues
  - CRITICAL: Never commit code with pylint errors or warnings unless explicitly justified with disable comments
